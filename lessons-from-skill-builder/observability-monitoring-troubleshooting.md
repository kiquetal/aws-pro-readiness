### Concepts

- Observability: A system is observable if its state
can be inferred from measurements. If that system
can be controlled and observed, it can be optimized.

Observability provides a holistic view of your workloads,
providing with rich context-based information.

The three pillars of observability are:

- Logs: A record of events that happened in a system.
- Metrics: A measurement of a system at a point in time.
- Traces: A record of a request as it travels through a system.


- Monitoring: The process of collecting, analyzing, and
acting upon metrics. Monitoring is a subset of observability.


Cloudwatch elements:

- Metrics: Set of time-ordered data points that are published to CloudWatch.
- Dimensions: An attribute of a metric. For example, instance id, environment, etc.
- Dashboards: A collection of widgets that display the most important metrics.
- Statistics: Metric data aggregations over time. For example, min, max, average, etc.
- Alarms: A notification that is sent when a metric is in a particular state.
- Access:
