### Concepts

- Observability: A system is observable if its state
can be inferred from measurements. If that system
can be controlled and observed, it can be optimized.

Observability provides a holistic view of your workloads,
providing with rich context-based information.

The three pillars of observability are:

- Logs: A record of events that happened in a system.
- Metrics: A measurement of a system at a point in time.
- Traces: A record of a request as it travels through a system.


- Monitoring: The process of collecting, analyzing, and
acting upon metrics. Monitoring is a subset of observability.
