### Architecting to scale

- Design for New Solutions
    
        Autoscaling policies and events
        Application integration ( SNS,SQS,Step Functions)
        Service quotas and limits
        Performance monitoring technologies

- Continuous Improvement for Existing Solutions.

        Monitoring and logging solutions
        High-performing system architectures
        Identifying and examining perfomance bottlenecks
        Scaling methodologies.


- Accelerate Workload Migration and Modernization

        Containers (ECS,EKS,Fargate,ECR)
        Serverless compute offerings (AWS Lambda)
        Integration Service(SQS,SNS,EventBridge,Step Functions)
