### Load Balancer -  

    Minimum of /27 subnet size.
    Architectural points
        - ELB is a DNS A record pointing at a 1+ Nodes Per AZ.
        - Nodes (in one subnet per AZ) can scale
        - Internet-facing means whole nodes have public IPv4 IPS
        - Interanl is private only IPs
        - EC2 doesn't need to be public to work with a LB.

#### Application Load Balancer vs Network Load Balancer.

    Classic Load Balancer does not scale, every unique HTTPS name requires an individual CLB
    because SNI isnÂ´t supported.


    Application Load Balancer:
    - Layer 7
    - HTTP, HTTPS, Websocket
    - Routing based on URL
    - Routing based on hostname
    - Routing based on path
    - Routing based on query string
    - Routing based on headers
    - Routing based on source IP
    - Routing based on HTTP method
    - Routing

    Network Load Balancer: Better perfomance than ALB.
    - Layer 4
    - TCP, TLS, UDP
    - Routing based on IP
    - Routing based on TCP port
    - Routing based on UDP port
