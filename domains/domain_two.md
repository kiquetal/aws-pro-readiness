## Domain 2: Design for New Solutions

### Task Statement 2.1: Design a deployment strategy to meet business requirements.

Knowledge of:

- Infraestructure as Code (for example, AWS Cloudformation)
- Continous integration and continous delivery (CI/CD)
- Change management processes
- Configuration management tools( for example AWS System Manager)

Skills in:

- Determining an application or upgrade path for new services and features
- Selecting services to develop deployment strategies and implement appropiate rollback mechaninsm
- Adopting managed services as needed to redure infraestructure provisioning and patching overhead
- Making advanced technologies accesible by deleting complex development and deployment taks to AWS

- Task Statement 2.2 : Design a solution to ensure business continuity

Knowledge of:

- AWS Global Infraetructure
- AWS networking concepts( for example route53, routing methods)
- RTOs and RPOs
- Disaster recovery scenarios( backup and restore, pilot light, warm standby, multi-site)
- Disaster recovery solutions on AWS

Skills in:

- Configuring disaster recovery solutions
- Configuring data and database replication
- Performing disaster recovery testing
- Architecting a backup solution that is automated, is cost-effective and supports business continuity across multiple Availability Zones or Regions,
- Designing an architectrur that provides applicataion and infraestructure availability in the event of a disruption.
- Using processes and components for centralized monitoring to proactively recover from system failures

### Task Statement 2.3: Determine security controls based on requirements.

Knowledge of:
- IAM
- Route tables, security groups and network ACLs
- Encryption  options for data at rest and data in transit
- AWS Service endpoints
- Credential management services
- AWS Managed security services ( AWS Shield, AWS WAF, Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Security hub)

Skill in:

- Specifying IAM users and IAM roles that adhere to the principle of least privileges access
- Specifying inbound and outbound network flows by using security group rules and network ACL rules
- Developing attack mitigation strategies for large-scale web applications
- Developing encryption strategies for data at rest and data in transit
- Specifying service endpoints for service integrations
- Developing strategies for patch management to remain compliant with organizational standards

### Task Statement 2.4: Design a stategy to meet reliability requirements.

Knowledge of

- AWS Global Infraestruture
- AWS Storage services and replication stratgies ( amazon S3, amazon RDS, elasticache)
