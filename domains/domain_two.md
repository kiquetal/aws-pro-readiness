### Systems Manager

- Hybrid
- Cross-platform
- Scalable
- AWS Optimized
- No complex licensing models
- Partner benefits

Capabilities:

- Run Command

      Remotely and securely run configuration actions at scale
        - Hybrid
        - Cross-platform
        - Scalable
      How does run command work? In a managed instance, requires document and some kind of invocation.
      Uses cases:
        - Monitoring your systems
        - On-demand patching
        - Deploying software
        - Run bootstrapping scripts on applictions

- State Manager
- Inventory
- Patch Manager
- Maintenance Window
- Automation
- Parameter Store
- Session Manager
- OpsCenter
- Explorer

## The Well-Architected Framework- six pillars

### Notes about Operational Excellence (excelencia operativa)

The operational excellence pillar includes
the ability to support development and run
workloads effectively, gain insight into their
operations, and to continuously improve
supporting processes and procedures to
deliver business value.

Design principles for operational excellence include

- Perform operations as code
- Annotate documentation
- Make frequent, small, reversible changes
- Refine operations procedures frequently
- Anticipate failure
- Learn from all operational failures

---
- Organization
- Prepare
- Operate
- Evolve

### Notes about Security (seguridad)

The security pillar encompasses the ability
to protect data, systems, and assets to take
advantage of cloud technologies to improve
your security.

Design principles for security include

- Implement a strong identity foundation
- Enable traceability
- Apply security at all layers
- Automate security best practices
- Protect data in transit and at rest
- Keep people away from data
- Prepare for security events

---

- Security Foundations
- Identity and Access Management
- Detective Controls
- Infrastructure Protection
- Data Protection
- Incident Response
- Application Security

### Notes about Reliability (fiabilidad)

The reliability pillar encompasses the ability
of a workload to perform its intended function
correctly and consistently when it's expected to.
This includes the ability to operate and test
the workload through its total lifecycle.

Design principles for reliability include

- Automatically recover from failure
- Test recovery procedures
- Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
- Stop guessing capacity
- Manage change in automation

---

- Foundations: Change Management
- Foundations: Failure Management
- Foundations: Workload architecture
- Foundations: Recovery Planning

### Notes about Performance Efficiency (eficiencia de rendimiento)

The performance efficiency pillar includes the
ability to use computing resources efficiently
to meet system requirements and to maintain
that efficiency as demand changes and
technologies evolve.

Design principles for performance efficiency include

- Democratize advanced technologies
- Go global in minutes
- Use serverless architectures
- Experiment more often
- Consider mechanical sympathy

---

- Selection
- Review
- Monitoring
- Tradeoffs


### Notes about Cost Optimization (optimizaci√≥n de costos)

- Adopt a consumption model
- Measure overall efficiency
- Stop spending money on data center operations
- Analyze and attribute expenditure

---
- Practice Cloud Financial Management
- Expenditure Awareness
- Cost-Effective Resources
- Matching supply and demand
- Optimizing over time

### Notes about sustainability (sostenibilidad)

- Understand your impact
- Establish sustainability goals
- Maxime utilization of resources
- Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware
