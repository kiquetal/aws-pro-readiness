#### New Architecture and Modernization

    An on-premises application has been selected
    for migration AWS. The application consists of a layer 7
    load balancer,an application runtime on virtual machines
    an NFS filesytess and a Postgresql database.

    How does AWS support container application ?
    Do container service support integtration with
    ALB?

    EKS considerations
    - AZ scope resources
    - Managed kubernetes service
    - Control plan only.

    An on-premsises application delivers logs to an analysis
    system which inserts the log entries into a relational
    database. Resports are generated from the database using
    mix of short and long-running queires against the data
    and indees.


    A company has a legacy workload which identifies
    new S3 objects for data proceesing. The workload
    uses a script which runs hourly to list objects written
    in the past hour and initiates the processing job
